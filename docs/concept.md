# SessionBridge — MVP Specification (Refined)

## 1. Core Problem

People experience meaningful emotional, cognitive, and situational events **between** support sessions (coaching, counseling, facilitation).
These events are often lost, distorted, or forgotten by the time the next human conversation happens.

Existing tools fail because they either:
- demand reflection discipline (journals),
- steer meaning (chatbots),
- or require institutional adoption (coach / corporate platforms).

The unmet need is **safe continuity without interpretation**.

## 2. Core Promise (Non-Negotiable)

SessionBridge provides:
> A private place to offload thoughts and experiences, store them reliably, and generate a neutral summary later — shared only with explicit user consent.

Nothing else.

No insight.
No advice.
No coaching.
No interpretation.
No diagnosis.

## 3. What the Product Is

SessionBridge is a **care-adjacent memory container**.

- User-owned by default
- Coach-optional, coach-compatible
- Silent by design, minimally acknowledging
- Focused on capture and recall, not meaning-making

It exists to **preserve signal**, not to improve it.

## 4. Target MVP Context

Primary MVP audience:
- NGO-supported individuals dealing with anxiety, ADHD, identity stress, LGBTQ+ issues, or emotional overwhelm

Why this group:
- Real between-session emotional load
- Existing human support relationship
- High sensitivity to judgment and interpretation
- Low tolerance for heavy structure or “self-improvement” framing

This is **not** a mass-market validation.
This is a truth-finding pilot.

## 5. User Entry Paths (Same Product)

### Path A: Coach-suggested
- Coach mentions the tool during a session
- User installs/uses independently
- Coach is not a system user
- Sharing is optional and initiated by the user

### Path B: Self-discovered
- User uses the tool privately
- May never share anything
- Product must still feel legitimate

Both paths are first-class.
No feature depends on a coach being present.

## 6. Daily Use Model

### Input
- One-line or short free-text entries
- No required format
- No minimum or maximum length
- No mandatory prompts

Examples:
- “Felt very anxious before the call.”
- “Didn’t sleep well. Racing thoughts.”
- “Felt okay today. Nothing special.”

### System Response (Strictly Limited)
Allowed responses only:
- “Saved.”
- “Noted.”
- “You can add more if you wish.”
- “This is stored privately.”

No questions.
No emotional labels.
No follow-ups.
No guidance.

The system behaves like **a recorder with manners**, not a listener with opinions.

## 7. Reports (On Demand Only)

- Generated only when the user explicitly requests
- Neutral, factual, chronological or lightly grouped
- Uses the user's own words wherever possible
- No interpretation, sentiment analysis, or conclusions

Purpose:
- Restore context before a session
- Help the user remember what mattered
- Optionally share with a coach or counselor

Sharing rules:
- Explicit, one-time consent
- Shareable as a static artifact (PDF/text)
- No live access, no dashboards

## 8. Privacy & Control Principles

Non-negotiable:
- User owns all data
- Nothing is shared by default
- Deletion is easy and visible
- Users can withhold, edit, or erase freely

Psychological safety > data retention.

## 9. What This Product Explicitly Does NOT Do

- No coaching
- No therapy
- No advice
- No nudging toward growth
- No goal tracking
- No streaks or gamification
- No emotional interpretation
- No proactive reminders in MVP

If it feels “helpful” in the moment, it is probably violating scope.

## 10. MVP Channel Decision

### Phase 1: WhatsApp (or equivalent)
Purpose:
- Test whether users naturally offload thoughts at all
- Measure real behavior, not stated intent

Constraints:
- One-way capture
- No conversational loop
- Clear first-message contract explaining silence

### Phase 2: Native App (Only if warranted)
- Offered only to users who actually used Phase 1
- Framed as a calmer, more contained space
- Fewer features, not more

## 11. Success Criteria (MVP)

Qualitative, not growth-based.

Signals of success:
- Users voluntarily write without reminders
- Some users request reports without being prompted
- Some users bring reports into sessions naturally
- Users describe the tool as “safe,” “quiet,” or “non-intrusive”

Signals of failure:
- Usage feels like homework
- Users expect responses or advice
- Silence feels confusing rather than calming
- Reports feel pointless or unused

## 12. Future Extensions (Out of MVP Scope)

Possible later stages:
- Coach accounts and paid licenses
- Aggregator or corporate flows
- Structured continuity formats

None of these should influence MVP design.

The MVP must stand on its own or be killed.

## 13. Internal Positioning Sentence

> “A quiet place to put what you’re carrying, without being reacted to — so it can still matter later.”

If this sentence feels insufficient, the product should not be built.
